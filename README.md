==================

Math

Package ebarrientos.utils.math. Has a Rational class that models rational numbers.


ADTs
----

Abstract Data Types. Meant to work correctly and use a typeclass approach in their

Some basic type classes are included for operations, like Eq and Functor.
Additionally, there are typeclasses to represent collections, finite collections,
ordered collections (lists and such), etc.
